## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using lm(), we created a linear regression model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file (Fig. 1) and using summary(), we are able to determine the p-value and r-squared value (Fig 2):

Using the results above, we are able to answer the following questions:
**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
